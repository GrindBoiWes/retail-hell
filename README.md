## Description
This app is an e-commerce backend app for adding, updating, and deleting items. Keeping your database up to date with the newest items, and also items that have sold out, is a very important factor in keeping your business booming. To get started, simply run npm start in the terminal. From there you will use localhost:3001/ your choosing of products, categories, or tags. Is there an item that is sold out currently? Find that by typing the correct route and make a delete request inside Insomnia.
